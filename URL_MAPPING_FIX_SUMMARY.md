# URL Mapping Fix for Cerebras Validation

## Problem Summary

The Cerebras AI validation system was experiencing a critical issue where:

1. **AI models successfully detected false positives** (e.g., "Model 1 flagged: 9, Model 2 flagged: 15, Unanimous: 2")
2. **Consensus was properly achieved** (e.g., "Validation complete: 2 false positives from 61 jobs")
3. **But no jobs were actually removed** (e.g., "Cerebras AI removed 0 false positives")

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was **URL normalization inconsistency** between two stages:

### Stage 1: Consensus Detection (Working Correctly)
- URLs were normalized for AI model comparison (removing query params, fragments, trailing slashes)
- Models compared normalized URLs: `https://company.com/job` vs `https://company.com/job`
- Consensus was properly detected between models

### Stage 2: Final Filtering (Broken)
- Filtering compared normalized URLs from consensus against original URLs from job data
- Mismatch: `https://company.com/job` (normalized) vs `https://company.com/job/?ref=portal` (original)
- Result: No matches found, no jobs removed despite valid consensus

## Solution Implemented

### 1. URL Mapping System
- **Created bidirectional mapping**: normalized URL ↔ original URL
- **Tracks all URL variations** during validation setup
- **Preserves original URL format** for accurate filtering

### 2. Enhanced Consensus Logic
- **Maintains normalized URLs** for AI model comparison (consistency)
- **Maps back to original URLs** before returning results
- **Provides detailed logging** for debugging URL transformations

### 3. Improved Filtering Logic
- **Exact URL matching** using original format URLs
- **Detailed removal tracking** with comprehensive logging
- **Mismatch detection** to identify remaining issues

## Code Changes

### cerebras_validator.py
1. **Added `_create_url_mapping()` method** - Creates normalized → original URL mapping
2. **Enhanced `validate_job_matches()`** - Uses mapping to return original URLs
3. **Improved logging** - Shows mapping statistics and URL transformations
4. **Better consensus debugging** - Logs successful consensus with actual URLs

### routes.py
1. **Enhanced filtering logic** - Detailed tracking of removal process
2. **Comprehensive logging** - Shows exactly which URLs are being compared and removed
3. **Mismatch detection** - Warns when expected removals don't occur
4. **Debug information** - Sample URLs comparison for troubleshooting

## Verification

### Test Results
✅ **URL Normalization**: Correctly normalizes various URL formats
✅ **URL Mapping**: Successfully maps normalized → original URLs  
✅ **Consensus Detection**: AI models agree on flagged URLs (normalized)
✅ **URL Conversion**: Converts normalized URLs back to original format
✅ **Exact Filtering**: Removes jobs using exact original URL matches

### Expected Behavior Change

**Before Fix:**
```
Model 1 (Qwen 3 32B) flagged: 9, Model 2 (Qwen 3 235B Instruct) flagged: 15, Unanimous: 2
Validation complete: 2 false positives from 61 jobs
Cerebras AI removed 0 false positives using models: ['Qwen 3 32B', 'Qwen 3 235B Instruct']
```

**After Fix:**
```
Model 1 (Qwen 3 32B) flagged: 9, Model 2 (Qwen 3 235B Instruct) flagged: 15, Unanimous: 2
Validation complete: 2 false positives from 61 jobs
URL mapping: 2 successful, 0 missing
Successfully removed 2 false positives:
  Removed: https://company1.com/job/?ref=portal
  Removed: https://company2.com/job#apply
Cerebras AI removed 2 false positives using models: ['Qwen 3 32B', 'Qwen 3 235B Instruct']
```

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
1. **AI consensus is properly respected** - When models agree, jobs are actually removed
2. **No false positives remain** - URL format differences don't prevent filtering
3. **Transparent operation** - Detailed logging shows exactly what's happening
4. **Robust URL handling** - Works with query parameters, fragments, trailing slashes, etc.

The system now operates as intended: AI models detect false positives → consensus is achieved → jobs are actually removed from results.
